#SSHack
## Getting Started
This tool does the following:
 - takes an IP (example: 192.168.0.0) and search the the subnet (192.168.0.0/24) for SSH open ports.
 - takes a username and a password to try on all the found IPs.
 - takes a username to make a new account with it.
 - takes a new password to change the hacked user password, and it uses the same password for the new account.
